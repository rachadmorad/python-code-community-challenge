# Using Netmiko & Netdev for getting Backup.

These example scripts use the Netmiko & Netdev Python library to backup with a device through CLI

If you don't know what is netmiko or netdev check these two link :
	- [Netmiko library](https://pypi.org/project/netmiko/)
	- [Netdev library](https://pypi.org/project/netdev/)

These Python scripts leverages Netmiko & Netdev to:
  - Create folder with name of this day
  - Inside the folder that was created befor, script will create folder with the name of any device in your lab.
  - Inside the folder of the device, script will do a backup for the device with name "running_config.cfg"

This script has been tested with Python 3.7.0, however may work with other versions.  

## Requirements

Python

- netmiko
- netdev
- asyncio

# Getting Started
* Clone the Python Examples and change into the directory.  

    ```bash
    git clone //github.com/campusnetworksecuritygeek/python-code-community-challenge/tree/master/Backup_MR_Python
    cd Backup_MR_Python
    ```

* Install the requirements

    ```bash
    pip3 install netmiko
    pip3 install netdev
    pip3 install asyncio
    ```

* 1- Testing Netmiko scripts :
    ```
		# cd Backup_MR_Python/Netmiko/
    # Run the backup script 
    $ python backup_netmiko.py
    # Output :

		```

* 2- Testing Netdev scripts :
    ```
		# cd Backup_MR_Python/Netmiko/
    # Run the backup script 
    $ python backup_netmiko.py
    # Output :
